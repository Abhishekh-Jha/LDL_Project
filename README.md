# LDL_Project Awareness & Risk Analytics
This project analyzes population-level LDL cholesterol awareness using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

# Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- SQL (data extraction & queries)
- Power BI (interactive dashboard)
- Statistics (logistic regression, chi-square tests, clustering)

# Files
- Jupyter notebooks: Data cleaning & analysis
- CSVs: Processed data exports
- .pbix: Power BI interactive dashboard

# Insights
- Awareness is lowest in young adults (18â€“30)
- Awareness disparities across ethnic groups (lowest: Mexican Americans)
- No gender gap observed

# Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard visualizes awareness by LDL category, age, gender, and ethnicity.

Action Plan
Focus 1: Youth awareness campaigns (digital/social health campaigns).
Focus 2: Targeted screening in Mexican American communities.
Focus 3: Reinforce communication for high-risk (LDL > 130 mg/dL) groups.
